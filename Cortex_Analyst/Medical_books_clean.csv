Deadly Feasts: Tracking the Secrets of a Terrifying New Plague,"By Rhodes, Richard","It lurks in the meat we eat. Undetectable, it incubates for years. It kills by eating holes in people's brains, so that they stagger and collapse and lose their minds. It's one hundred percent fatal. And it's already abroad in America. Deadly Feasts reads like a Michael Crichton thriller - but it's documented fact, bringing sober early warning of a new threat to our very lives that every one of us needs to heed.In this brilliant and gripping medical detective story, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes follows the daring explorations of maverick scientists as they track the emergence of the deadly ""stealth"" maladies known as prion diseases - strange new disease agents unlike any others known on earth. Mad cow disease is one. Besides hundreds of thousands of cattle, young people in Britain and France have already died from it - died from eating beef.Beginning with a cannibal feast in New Guinea only a few decades ago that killed everyone who partook, Rhodes shows this mysterious group of human and animal diseases spreading gradually throughout the world, infecting and killing laboratory animals; patients in surgery; herds of sheep, cattle, mink, deer and elk; children treated with human growth hormone; and now, ominously, healthy young people in Britain and on the Continent. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announcement in early 1997 of drastic measures to prevent an outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States confirmed what Rhodes reveals and explores in detail: that Americans who eat meat are almost certainly already at risk."," Medical , Diseases",Simon & Schuster,5.29,March,1997

Raising the Dead: A Doctor's Encounter with His Own Mortality,"By Selzer, Richard","On a spring afternoon in 1991, Richard Selzer, a retired surgeon and renowned medical essayist, collapsed while gazing from his study window. He was rushed to the hospital where he had practiced for many years, his former colleagues frantically struggling to contain the chaos toward which his body's systems were rampaging. Diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease, Selzer lapsed into a coma and began a painful journey to a place where there was ""more than a hint of death.""Raising the Dead is Selzer's vivid account of that journey - a trip to the underworld of disease, a world whose horrors are eased only by dementia, a place where death is as close as a lover. While his wife, children, doctors, and a gritty, wisecracking Irish nurse hover over him, Selzer suffers through the pain and indignity of medical procedures and the agonizing hallucinations that follow coma. Yet he ""invites the IV pole, the respirator, the whole massive bank of machinery to suggest the background for a story."" This story, the mysterious drama of the struggle between life and death, he relates with great power, elegance, and, surprisingly, wit. Few have been players in this drama and lived to tell about it. Fewer still, if any, can write about it with the intelligence and profundity of Richard Selzer."," Medical , Pathology",Viking Adult,5.29,February,1994

Neale Donald Walsch on Holistic Living,"By Walsch, Neale Donald","I have learned about life that when we live wholly, we live holy. I have been searching for ways to live my life as a whole person, as an integrated being, for twenty-five years. The first thing I came to understand was that, if I am to live an integrated life, I must become far more integrated with my environment. That is, I must become one with it, and treat it as if it were a part of me, not something from which I was separate, and which was separate from me.Holistic living means being aware that I am part of a whole system, a whole idea, a whole reality, and that everything I think, say, and do affects that reality--indeed, at some level, creates it.Are we able to coexist with nature, the universe, and our fellow human beings? Can we live lives that are joyous, harmonious, and largely pain-free? Do we have the ability to tell the truth and change what doesn't work?Neale Donald Walsch thinks so. Living well--physically, mentally, and spiritually--is within our grasp, should we choose to do so.

Sadly, it is a tradition lost. But at what cost?In this powerful book, Debra Evans eloquently and clearly presents what thousands of pages of research document: women's health care is in crisis. She details how medical ""experts"" have taken the place of mothers and grandmothers. How the womb has been rendered optional for procreation now that new techniques allow life to begin in a petrie dish. How doctors are ""liberating"" women from their biological, God-designed destiny and are disregarding medical and moral norms at the expense of their patients' emotions, finances, and bodies. And how, as the traditional domain of women has become the technical domain of doctors, our reproductive competency and dependence on God has increasingly eroded and been sabotaged by our trust in medical professionals and their technology.But Evans also reminds us of a better way.

Fibromyalgia, they explain, is a pain amplification, brought on by abnormal interactions between hormones, the immune system, neurotransmitters, and the autonomic nervous system. Sometimes the syndrome occurs spontaneously; in most cases, the authors write, it is associated with trauma, stress, such conditions as lupus and hypothyroidism, and over forty microbes, from hepatitis to Epstein Barr to Lyme disease. They draw on actual cases to illustrate their points  and to break through the isolation that patients often feel when doctors misdiagnose or simply ignore their symptoms.      When Dr. Wallace wrote The Lupus Book, he brought hope and relief into the lives of countless Americans, in a book that sold through many printings. In Making Sense of Fibromyalgia, the authors address a desperate need for information and reassurance, in a groundbreaking book."," Medical , Rheumatology",Oxford University Press,5.29,January,1999

The Ethical Brain,"By Gazzaniga, Michael S.","Will increased scientific understanding of our brains overturn our beliefs about moral and ethical behavior? How will increasingly powerful brain imaging technologies affect the ideas of privacy and of self-incrimination? Such thought-provoking questions are rapidly emerging as new discoveries in neuroscience have raised difficult legal and ethical dilemmas. Michael Gazzaniga, widely considered to be the father of cognitive neuroscience, investigates with an expert eye some of these controversial and complex issues in The Ethical Brain. He first examines ""lifespan neuroethics"" and considers how brain development defines human life, from when an embryo develops a brain and could be considered ""one of us"" to the issues raised as the brain ages, such as whether we should have complete freedom to extend our lives and enhance our brains through the use of genetics, pharmaceuticals, and training. Gazzaniga also considers the challenges posed to the justice system by new discoveries in neuroscience. Recent findings suggest that our brain has already made a decision before we become fully aware of doing so, raising the question of whether the concept of personal responsibility can remain a fundamental tenet of the law. Gazzaniga argues that as neuroscience learns more about the unreliability of human memory, the very foundation of trial law will be challenged. Gazzaniga then discusses a radical re-evaluation of the nature of moral belief, as he not only looks at possibly manipulating the part of the brain that creates beliefs but also explores how scientific research is building a brain-based account of moral reasoning. The Ethical Brain is a groundbreaking volume that presents neuroscience's loaded findings--and their ethical implications--in an engaging and readable manner, offering an incisive and thoughtful analysis of the medical ethics challenges confronting modern society at the dawn of the twenty-first century."," Medical , Neuroscience",Dana Press,5.29,April,2005

The South Beach Heart Program: The 4-Step Plan that Can Save Your Life (The South Beach Diet),"By Agatston, Arthur, M.D.","A pioneering cardiologist and the author of the international bestseller The South Beach Diet presents the truth about cardiac care in this country and offers his proven program for preventing heart attacks and strokes. This year alone more than 1 million men and women in this country will suffer a heart attack or stroke. The shocking fact is that the majority of heart attacks and strokes can be prevented with the medical knowledge we already possess. Yet this isn‚Äôt happening. Why? Because doctors and hospitals are paid more to treat disease with invasive techniques like angioplasty and bypass surgery than to prevent it. In his most personal and passionate work yet, Dr. Arthur Agatston champions a revolution in heart disease prevention that will enable people to stay out of the hospital and off the operating table. In Part 1 of this compelling book, he tells you why seemingly healthy people can suddenly have a heart attack and why people with great cholesterol numbers can be walking time bombs. He explains why belly fat can be an early warning sign of future heart disease and why a noninvasive heart scan can help predict your risk of heart attack. In Part 2, he presents the South Beach Heart Program, his 4-step plan for detecting, preventing, and even reversing heart disease: The 4 steps include: Heart-healthy eating, regular aerobic and core-strengthening exercise, state-of-the art diagnostic testing, and the latest heart-protective medications, as necessary. Thanks to his aggressive prevention approach, Dr. Agatston rarely sees a heart attack or stroke in his practice.

In Another Day in the Frontal Lobe, Dr. Firlik draws on this rare combination to create a neurosurgeon‚Äôs Kitchen Confidential‚Äìa unique insider‚Äôs memoir of a fascinating profession.Neurosurgeons are renowned for their big egos and aggressive self-confidence, and Dr. Firlik confirms that timidity is indeed rare in the field. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the kids who never lost at musical chairs,‚Äù she writes. A brain surgeon is not only a highly trained scientist and clinician but also a mechanic who of necessity develops an intimate, hands-on familiarity with the gray matter inside our skulls. It‚Äôs the balance between cutting-edge medical technology and manual dexterity, between instinct and expertise, that Firlik finds so appealing‚Äìand so difficult to master.  Firlik recounts how her background as a surgeon‚Äôs daughter with a strong stomach and a keen interest in the brain led her to this rarefied specialty, and she describes her challenging, atypical trek from medical student to fully qualified surgeon. Among Firlik‚Äôs more memorable cases: a young roofer who walked into the hospital with a three-inch-long barbed nail driven into his forehead, the result of an accident with his partner‚Äôs nail gun, and a sweet little seven-year-old boy whose untreated earache had become a raging, potentially fatal infection of the brain lining.

The Thyroid Solution: A Mind-Body Program for Beating Depression and Regaining Your Emotional and Phys ical Health,"By Arem, Ridha, M.D.","It's sometimes called a hidden epidemic: One in ten Americans--more than twenty million people--has a thyroid disorder. At any given time, millions of people have an undiagnosed thyroid disorder and experience a chronic mental anguish that almost certainly arises from the very same source. This health crisis flourishes in the shadows of the medical community because many primary-care doctors still don't recognize the importance of the thyroid in mind-body health. In fact, when they do diagnose a thyroid disorder, they treat it as a simple physical problem rather than what it really is: a complex blow to the body and mind--and an increasingly common cause of clinical depression, weight gain, fibromyalgia, high cholesterol, memory loss, anxiety, and other disorders. It's time to treat the source and not the symptom!The Thyroid Solution is the first mind-body approach to identifying and curing thyroid imbalances. Written by a medical pioneer and leading authority in the field of thyroid research, this groundbreaking book offers Dr. Ridha Arem's practical program for maintaining thyroid health through diet, exercise, and stress control--and through his revolutionary medical plan, which combines two types of hormone treatments with astounding results. Inside you'll discover- The thyroid basics--what it is, where it is, what it does- How thyroid hormones affect the brain and alter mood, emotions, and behavior- The difference between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and why both conditions are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed- What tests to ask your doctor to give you--and what they mean- The facts your physician may not know about your thyroid, depression, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome- The vital connection between stress and thyroid imbalance- The benefits of antioxidants and essential fatty-acid foods and supplements- How to recognize and cure the deep and lingering effects of a thyroid imbalance- How thyroid hormone can work as an antidepressant when your thyroid gland is normal and conventional antidepressants have failedFilled with remarkable and dramatic patient histories and interviews that document the dramatic results of Dr. Arem's bold new treatments, The Thyroid Solution now gives you and your doctor the tools you need to live a life with peace of mind . . . and body."," Medical , Endocrinology & Metabolism",Ballantine Books,5.62,June,1999
"Dirty Politics: Deception, Distraction, and Democracy","By Jamieson, Kathleen Hall","Americans in recent years have become thoroughly disenchanted with our political campaigns, especially with campaign advertising and speeches. Each year, as November approaches, we are bombarded with visceral appeals that bypass substance, that drape candidates in the American flag but tell us nothing about what they'll do if elected, that flood us with images of PT-109 or Willie Horton, while significant issues--such as Kennedy's Addison's Disease or the looming S&L catastrophe--are left unexamined. And the press--the supposed safeguard of democracy--focuses on campaign strategy over campaign substance, leaving us to decide where the truth lies.      In Dirty Politics, campaign analyst Kathleen Hall Jamieson provides an eye-opening look at political ads and speeches, showing us how to read, listen to, and watch political campaigns. Jamieson provides a sophisticated (and often humorous) analysis of advertising technique, describing how television ads use soft focus, slow motion, lyrical or patriotic music (Reagan used ""I'm Proud to be an American"") to place a candidate in a positive light, or quick cuts, black and white, videotape, and ominous music (for instance, the theme from ""Jaws"") to portray the opposition. She shows how ads sometimes mimic news spots to add authenticity (Edwin Edwards, in his race against David Duke, actually used former NBC correspondent Peter Hackis, who would begin an ad saying ""This is Peter Hackis in Baton Rouge""). And Jamieson points out that consultants create inflammatory ads hoping that the major networks will pick them up and run them as news, giving the ad millions of dollars of free air time. The most striking example would be the Willie Horton ad, which the press aired repeatedly (as an example of negative advertising) long after the ad had ceased running. (In fact, it never ran on the major networks as an ad, only as news.)       From a colorful, compact history of negative campaigning from Eisenhower to the present, to an in-depth commentary on the Willie Horton ads, to an up-to-the-minute analysis of the Duke-Edwards campaign in Louisiana, Dirty Politics is both a fascinating look at underhanded campaigning as well as a compelling argument for fair, accurate, and substantive campaigns.

"Disease Prevention and Treatment, 4th Edition",By Life Extension Foundation (EDT),"The public too often hears about a new life-saving therapy, only to be told that the treatment won't be available for many years. The Life Extension Foundation is proud to release the fourth edition of Disease Prevention and Treatment. This significantly expanded fourth edition provides 1,535 pages of concise information about therapies that are documented in the scientific literature, but are not routinely incorporated into clinical medical practice. Many of the recommendations in this latest edition of DiseasePrevention and Treatment provide inside information about what innovative physicians are doing to prevent and treat the degenerative diseases of aging. Disease Prevention and Treatment contains novel information that the general public and their doctors are largely unaware of. A few examples of the kind of unique information contained in this book include: ¬¢ A drug that is 92% effective in preventing the flu in people who have been exposed to influenza. ¬¢ A simple head positioning technique that resolves vertigo symptoms in 50% of cases. ¬¢ Proven methods to reduce prescription drug side effects while saving big dollars on your drug purchases. ¬¢ A nutrient that suppresses excess insulin production, resulting in reduced carbohydrate craving and subsequent body fat reduction. ¬¢ The devastating role that chronic inflammation plays in degenerative disease and novel methods of suppressing the inflammatory cascade. ¬¢ A simple blood test that predicts your risk of developing type II diabetes four years ahead of time. ¬¢ Hormone imbalances that cause mental depression and how you can correct these. ¬¢ FDA-approved drugs that fight cancer, but are over-looked by most oncologists. ¬¢ Novel methods to treat either constipation-or diarrhea type irritable bowel syndrome. ¬¢ Steps you can take right now to dramatically reduce stroke risk. ¬¢ Eight critical steps to controlling or curing cancer that are not routinely used in conventional oncology practice. ¬¢ The missing link that causes fibromyalgia patients to endure chronic pain. ¬¢ The most effective drug to alleviate the miseries of insomnia. ¬¢ Why anti-hypertensive drugs often fail to adequately control high blood pressure and how the dose can be adjusted to make them work better. ¬¢ The only therapy shown to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease (by 44%) over a 16-month study period. ¬¢ A nutritional protocol for autistic children that parents said doubled improvement in just eight weeks. ¬¢ A European drug that protects against glaucoma-induced optic nerve damage. ¬¢ A French drug that lowers infections associated with chronic bronchitis by 60% ¬¢ Precautions one should take when supplementing with DHEA. ¬¢ Safer estrogen replacement drugs to relieve menopausal miseries. ¬¢ An OTC drug that can knock out herpes outbreaks within 24 to 48 hours.

The protocols discussed in this book are documented by thousands of published studies from internationally recognized scientific journals.

The Three-Pound Enigma: The Human Brain and the Quest to Unlock Its Mysteries,"By Moffett, Shannon","The average human brain weighs three pounds‚Äî80 percent of which is water‚Äîand yet it's capable of outstripping the computational and storage capacities of the most complex computer. But how the mind works remains one of humankind's greatest mysteries. With boundless curiosity and enthusiasm, Shannon Moffett, a Stanford medical student, takes us down the halls of neuroscience to the front lines of cutting-edge research and medicine to meet some of today's most extraordinary scientists and thinkers, all grappling with provocative questions: Why do we dream? How does memory work? How do we see? What happens when we think? Each chapter delves into a different aspect of the brain, following the experts as they chart new ground. Moffett takes us to a lab where fMRI scans reveal the multitude of stimuli that our brains unconsciously take in; inside an operating room where a neurosurgeon removes a bullet from a patient's skull; to the lab of Christof Koch, a neuroscientist tracking individual neurons in order to crack the code of consciousness; and to a research lab where scientists are investigating the relationship between dreams and waking life.

The Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office,"By Morone, James A. and Blumenthal, David","Even the most powerful men in the world are human&#151;they get sick, take dubious drugs, drink too much, contemplate suicide, fret about ailing parents, and bury people they love. Young Richard Nixon watched two brothers die of tuberculosis, even while doctors monitored a suspicious shadow on his own lungs. John Kennedy received last rites four times as an adult, and Lyndon Johnson suffered a ""belly buster"" of a heart attack. David Blumenthal and James A. Morone explore how modern presidents have wrestled with their own mortality&#151;and how they have taken this most human experience to heart as they faced the difficult politics of health care. Drawing on a trove of newly released White House tapes, on extensive interviews with White House staff, and on dramatic archival material that has only recently come to light, The Heart of Power explores the hidden ways in which presidents shape our destinies through their own experiences. Taking a close look at Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, the book shows what history can teach us as we confront the health care challenges of the twenty-first century."," Medical , History",University of California Press,19.96,June,2009

Yet brain scientists have uncovered details every business leader, parent, and teacher should know&#151;like the need for physical activity to get your brain working its best.How do we learn? What exactly do sleep and stress do to our brains? Why is multi-tasking a myth? Why is it so easy to forget&#151;and so important to repeat new knowledge? Is it true that men and women have different brains?In Brain Rules, Dr. John Medina, a molecular biologist, shares his lifelong interest in how the brain sciences might influence the way we teach our children and the way we work.

"The Pain Chronicles: Cures, Myths, Mysteries, Prayers, Diaries, Brain Scans, Healing, and the Science of Suffering","By Thernstrom, Melanie","Each of us will know physical pain in our lives, but none of us knows when it will come or how long it will stay. Today as much as 10 percent of the population of the United States suffers from chronic pain. It is more widespread, misdiagnosed, and undertreated than any major disease. While recent research has shown that pain produces pathological changes to the brain and spinal cord, many doctors and patients still labor under misguided cultural notions and outdated scientific dogmas that prevent proper treatment, to devastating effect.In The Pain Chronicles, a singular and deeply humane work, Melanie Thernstrom traces conceptions of pain throughout the ages‚Äîfrom ancient Babylonian pain-banishing spells to modern brain imaging‚Äîto reveal the elusive, mysterious nature of pain itself. Interweaving first-person reflections on her own battle with chronic pain, incisive reportage from leading-edge pain clinics and medical research, and insights from a wide range of disciplines‚Äîscience, history, religion, philosophy, anthropology, literature, and art‚ÄîThernstrom shows that when dealing with pain we are neither as advanced as we imagine nor as helpless as we may fear.Both a personal meditation and an intellectual exploration, The Pain Chronicles illuminates and makes sense of the all-too-human experience of pain‚Äîand confronts with extraordinary grace and empathy its peculiar traits, its harrowing effects, and its various antidotes."," Medical , Pain Medicine","Farrar, Straus and Giroux",5.41,August,2010

Tales of the Earth: Paroxysms and Perturbations of the Blue Planet,"By Page, Jake and Officer, Charles","In Maryland, late in the spring of 1816, the snow fell brown, and blue, and even red. Brown snow fell in Hungary that year, and in the village of Taranto in southern Italy, where any snow is rare, the red and yellow snow caused great alarm. In New England, 1816 was called the Year Without a Summer. Crops failed throughout America, the price of corn and wheat soared, and farmers (lacking feed) sold off livestock, bringing about a collapse in beef and pork prices. In Western Europe, it was even worse, a major disaster, with food riots and armed groups raiding bakeries and grain markets. This turmoil followed a catastrophic volcanic eruption a year earlier on the other side of the world--the April 1815 explosion of the volcano called Tambora, on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa--a blast heard almost a thousand miles away in Sumatra.    In Tales of the Earth, Charles Officer and Jake Page describe some of the great events of environmental history, from natural catastrophes such as the Tambora eruption, the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 (the greatest in recorded history), and the ice ages, to disasters such as the nuclear fallout from Chernobyl, acid rain, and the progressive depletion of the ozone layer. Officer and Page present much of their narrative through eye-witness accounts or through the commentary of prominent figures (in discussing the Lisbon earthquake, for instance, they recount the famous clash between Voltaire and Rousseau over the meaning of the disaster, and in discussing the Black Plague, they quote Boccaccio, whose Decameron was set during ""the late deadly pestilence""). The authors provide fascinating discussions of meteorites and comets; of the demise of mammoths, mastodons, and dinosaurs; and of great floods that have swept the earth.     But if nature can make trouble for humanity, Officer and Page show that human activity can also make trouble for nature. They examine the depletion of natural resources (we burn coal and oil at millions of times their natural rate of production), air pollution in such major urban areas as Los Angeles and London (where the Killer Smog of 1952 caused the death of some four thousand people), and the pollution of major waterways, like the Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie. And they explore the global impact of such phenomena as depletion of the ozone layer, acid rain, population growth, and the greenhouse effect.  Ranging from catastrophic eruptions at Santorini and Krakatoa to manmade disasters such as the mercury poisoning in Japan's Minamata Bay, Tales of the Earth will interest anyone concerned with the environment and the natural world."," Medical , Gynecology & Obstetrics",Oxford University Press,5.42,July,1993
